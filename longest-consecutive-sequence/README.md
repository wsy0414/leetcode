# Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Problem Description

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

## Test Cases

Example 1:
```go
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

Example 2:
```go
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

## My Answer Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
