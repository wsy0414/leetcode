# Two Sum

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the `target`.

You can assume that each input will have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Test Cases

Example 1:
```go
Input: nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7
Output: [0,1]
```

Example 2:
```go
Input: nums = [4,5,6], target = 10
Output: [0,2]
```

Example 3:
```go
Input: nums = [5,5], target = 10
Output: [0,1]
```
