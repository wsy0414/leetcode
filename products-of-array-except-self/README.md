# Product of Array Except Self

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

## Test Cases

Example 1:
```go
Input: nums = [1,2,4,6]
Output: [48,24,12,8]
```

Example 2:
```go
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,3]
Output: [0,-6,0,0,0]
```

## My Answer Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
