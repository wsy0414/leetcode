# Encode and Decode Strings

## Problem Description

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

## Test Cases

Example 1:
```go
Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]
Output: ["neet", "code", "love", you"]
```

Example 2:
```go
Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]
Output: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
```

## My Answer Complexity Analysis

### Encode
- **Time Complexity:** O(N)
- **Space Complexity:** O(N)

### Decode
- **Time Complexity:** O(N)
- **Space Complexity:** O(N)
